# Bootstrap Video-Background Landing Page
A simple bootstrap based video-background landing page with modals that I did for a friend's online training business (never went live). 

All external scripts load via CDN (jquery, bootstrap, modernizr, afterglow).

Putting it out with an MIT license, use it as a landing page template if needed.

- [x] full-page background video (with stripped out audio channel)
- [x] logo coordinated colors
- [x] fully responsive
- [x] simple css animation
